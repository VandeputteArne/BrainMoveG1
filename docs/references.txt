# UUID References
# Keep all your UUIDs here to ensure consistency across devices
# These UUIDs must match EXACTLY between ESP32 firmware and Raspberry Pi backend

# BLE Service UUID (Main service for BrainMove devices)

# BLE Characteristic UUIDs
CHAR_DATA_UUID = beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361b26a8      # For notifications (ESP32 -> RPi)
CHAR_COMMAND_UUID = beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361b26a9  # For commands (RPi -> ESP32)

# Security
MAGIC_BYTE = 0x42  # Authentication byte in message headers
BLE_PAIRING_PIN = 589175  # PIN for BLE pairing/bonding

# Usage Instructions:
# 1. Copy these UUIDs to your ESP32 firmware (.ino or .cpp files)
# 2. Copy these UUIDs to your Raspberry Pi backend (Python files)
# 3. Never change UUIDs unless you update BOTH devices
# 4. If devices can't connect, verify UUIDs match exactly
